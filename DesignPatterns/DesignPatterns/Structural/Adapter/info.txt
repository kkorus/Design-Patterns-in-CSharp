Intent
	• Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
	Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
	incompatible interfaces.

	• Wrap an existing class with a new interface.

	• Impedance match an old component to a new system

Rules of thumb
	• Adapter makes things work after they're designed; Bridge makes
	them work before they are.

	• Bridge is designed up-front to let the abstraction and the
	implementation vary independently. Adapter is retrofitted to make
	unrelated classes work together.

	• Adapter provides a different interface to its subject. Proxy provides
	the same interface. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.

	• Adapter is meant to change the interface of an existing object.
	Decorator enhances another object without changing its interface.
	Decorator is thus more transparent to the application than an adapter is.	
	As a consequence, Decorator supports recursive composition, which
	isn't possible with pure Adapters.

	• Facade defines a new interface, whereas Adapter reuses an old
	interface. Remember that Adapter makes two existing interfaces work
	together as opposed to defining an entirely new one.
